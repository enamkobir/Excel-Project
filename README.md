## BD Crime Rate Analysis
I'm excited to share my latest excel project named "BD crime rate analysis".

# Data set use
-<a href="https://github.com/enamkobir/Excel-Project/blob/main/Crime%20Rate%20Dataset%20-%20By%20Enam.xlsx">Data Set View"</a>
Dataset Description

Each row represents a police division (e.g., DMP, CMP, RMP, etc.), and columns represent the number of cases recorded under different crime categories in 2015, such as:
Dacoity
Robbery
Murder
Speedy Trial and more.
Part 1: Descriptive Statistics
Calculate total crimes per division.
Identify the top 3 and bottom 3 divisions by total reported crimes.
Compute the mean and standard deviation of each crime type.
Part 2: Visualization
Create a bar chart showing total crimes per division.
Create a heatmap showing crime type intensities across divisions.
Plot a pie chart for one division (e.g., DMP) showing its crime type distribution.
Part 3: Insights & Interpretation
Write a short analysis (300 words +- ) discussing:
Which regions seem most affected by serious crimes (e.g., murder, robbery)?
Which crime types dominate across most divisions?
What potential factors could explain the observed differences (urbanization, population density, etc.)?
